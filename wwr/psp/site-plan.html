      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Paola Tambo and I am an avid traveler and explorer. I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, but my passion for life and adventure took me to leave my home country to embark on a new journey. I am a nature lover and enjoy visiting historical places with my family whether they be close or far away from home!
